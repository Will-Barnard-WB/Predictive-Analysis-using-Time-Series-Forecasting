SARIMA

- SARIMA stands for Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
- This can be broken down into 4 parts: S, AR, I and MA.

- (1-phi(1)B-...-phi(p)B^p)(1-PHI(1)B^s-....-PHI(P)B^Ps)Y(t) = (1+theta(1)B+...+theta(q)B^q)(1+THETA(q)B^s+...+THETA(q)B^Qs)(error at t)

Seasonality (S):
- Patterns in the data that repeat over regular intervals.
- E.g. temperature following a yearly cycle with higher temperatures in the summer, and lower temperatures in the winter.

Autoregression (AR):
- Predicting the current value of a time series based on its own past values.
- Assumes past values in the data have a direct impact on future values.
- Expresses the current value as a linear functoin of its previous values (lags). It captures the dependence between the curent value
  and its past.
- Y(t) = phi(1)Y(t-1) + phi(2)Y(t-2) + ... + phi(p)Y(t-p) + (error at time t)

Integrated (I):
- Ensuring that data is stationary. 
- A stationary series has consistent mean, variance and covariance over time.
- To make data stationary, we perform differencing. 
- Perform non-seasonal differencing if data isn't stationary (contains a trend), and seasonal differencing if the ACF plot shows significant   lags at multiples of the seasonal preriod.
- Y(t)' = Y(t) - Y(t-1) *non-seasonal*
- Y(t)' = Y(t) - Y(t-12) *seasonal*

Moving Average (MA):
- Using past errors (or residuals) of the predictions to make bettwe forecasts.
- Can be thought of as adjusting yout predictions based on how much you were wrong in the past.
- It is effectively a weighted sum of past errors (residuals), and models how past shocks (or noise) affect future values.
- Y(t) = (mean of the series) + (error at time t) + (theta(1))(error at time (t-1)) + ... + theta(q)(error at time (t-q))

SARIMA is an extension of the ARIMA model, that handles seasonal data, hence the 'S'.
SARIMA can be written as: SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, m)

Non-seasonal parameters:
- p = number of autoregressive terms (AR)
- d = number of differencing steps (to make the series stationary)
- q = number of moving average terms (MA)

Seasonal parameters:
- P = seasonal autoregressive terms (seasonal AR)
- D = seasonal differencing steps (seasonal trends)
- Q = seasonal moving average terms (seasonal MA)
- m = number of periods in each season

We can find these parameters from our ACF and PACF graphs.

ACF (Autocorrelation Function):
- ACF tells you how similar the data at one point is to the data at another point in the past.
- It measures the relatiosnhip between a series and its lags (previous time periods).
- If the ACF shows high values at certain lags, it means there is a strong relationship between the current value and the value at that lag.
- ACF at lag k = Cov(Y(t), Y(t-k) / root ( Var(Y(t)) . Var(Y(t-k)) ) 

PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)
- Similar to the ACF, but removes the influence of all the other lags in the data, and shows you the direct relationship between the current 
  value and a specific past value (lag).
- PACF tells you the direct correlation between the current value adn a past value.
- PACF at lag k = Corr(Y(t), Y(t-k) | Y(t-1),Y(t-2),...,Y(t-(k-1)) ) 

To find parameter 'p':
- Look at the PACF plot to determine the number of lags to include in the model.
- If the PACF cuts off after a certain lag, then p is the lag at which the PACF stops being significant. 

To find parameter 'd':
- Rounds of differencing are used to make a time series stationary.
- If the time series has a clear trend (e.g. up or down), you might need to perform rounds of differencing to remove that trend.
- To check if differencing has worked, you can plot the ACF of the differenced series. If the ACF shows no significant lags (drops to near     zero quickly), the series is stationary.

To find parameter 'q':
- Look at the ACF plot to detmerine the number of MA terms to include.
- If the ACF drops after a certain lag, then q is the lag at which the ACF stops being significant. 

To find parameter 'P':
- Look at the PACF plot for the seasonal lags (multiples of the seasonal period).
- E.g. for yearly seasonality, look at lags 12, 24, 36 etc.
- Apply the same criteria as that for finding 'p'.

To find parameter 'D':
- Rounds of seasonal differencing performed.
- It is similar to standard differencing but is done on the seasonal lags.
- For example, for monthly data with yearly seasonality, the seasonal differencing formula is Y(t) - Y(t-12).

To find parameter 'Q':
- Look at the ACF plot for the seasonal lags (multiples of the seasonal period).
- Apply the same crieria as the for finding 'q'.
