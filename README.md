# Time Series Analysis for Predicting Future Sales Data

---

## Overview

This project focuses on **time series analysis** to predict future sales data using various machine learning and statistical models.

A **time series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, such as daily stock prices, monthly rainfall, or hourly temperature readings.

---

## Models Used

- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost**

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination)

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning Methods

To optimize model performance, the following hyperparameter tuning techniques are implemented:

- **Bayesian Optimization**  
- **Grid Search**  
- **Random Search**  
- **AutoARIMA** (for automated parameter selection in ARIMA models)

---

## Analytical Techniques

Additional analyses include:

- Cross-correlation analysis  
- Fourier terms for seasonality  
- ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)  
- Seasonal decomposition  
- ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test for stationarity  
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability

## Streamlit Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit** showcases model results, forecasts, and visualizations.
